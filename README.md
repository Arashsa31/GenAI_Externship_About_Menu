This project involves creating a Python program that demonstrates recursion and function usage through interactive examples. The program presents a menu of options for the user to choose from, including calculating the factorial of a number, finding the nth Fibonacci number, and drawing a recursive fractal pattern (bonus task). It will handle input validation, provide user-friendly prompts, and include detailed comments to explain the functions.
